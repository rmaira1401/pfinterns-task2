Global Energy Flow Analysis.
This project focuses on the Global Energy Trade Analysis, exploring various aspects of
global energy production, exchange, and consumption. Using the international energy
statistics dataset from Kaggle, the analysis covers primary and secondary energy
sources, both conventional and renewable. The dashboard will provide a comprehensive
view of global energy dynamics, including trends like the expansion of wind energy and
energy consumption as a measure of national economies. Power BI visualizations, such
as Bar Charts, Flow Maps, Ribbon Charts, and Treemaps, will be employed to illustrate
energy production, trade flows, and usage, offering critical insights into the global energy
landscape.
